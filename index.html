    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Portfolio of a designer and developer from Australia who "likes to turn complex tasks into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs." These words are also embodied in his site, on which Adham also blogs with useful tips for specialists.</p>
    <p>The most boring portfolio. The author is engaged in designing, writing code, creating content and dreaming about the 1980s and 1990s. According to Jack, he was tired of boring sites, which is why he made his portfolio in a "stupid" style.</p>
    <p>A portfolio stuffed with animation. Its author specializes in software development for clients ranging from private individuals and small businesses to large corporations. It's a good portfolio in its own way, but some may be confused by the not very well-matched colors and fonts.</p>
